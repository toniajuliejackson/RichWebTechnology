		div-1 <br /> In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is a
		filler text commonly used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a
		document or visual presentation. Replacing meaningful content that
		could be distracting with placeholder text may allow viewers to focus
		on graphic aspects such as font, typography, and page layout.

		<div id="div-1a">
			Div-1a <br> The lorem ipsum text is typically a scrambled
			section of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC Latin text
			by Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed such that it is
			nonsensical, improper Latin.
		</div>
		
		<div id="div-1b">
			Div-1b <br> A variation of the ordinary lorem ipsum text has
			been used in typesetting since the 1960s or earlier, when it was
			popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. It was
			introduced to the Information Age in the mid-1980s by Aldus
			Corporation, which employed it in graphics and word processing
			templates for its desktop publishing program, PageMaker, for the
			Apple Macintosh.[1]
